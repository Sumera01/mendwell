            <h2>What is an Eating Disorder?</h2>
            <img src="eating.png" alt="Eating Disorder">
            <p>An eating disorder is a mental health condition that involves unhealthy or abnormal eating behaviors, such as
                extreme restriction of food intake, binge eating, or purging behaviors. These disorders can affect physical,
                emotional, and mental health and often require professional treatment for recovery.</p>
            <p>Common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. These conditions
                can affect individuals of all ages, genders, and backgrounds, and are often linked to underlying issues such
                as low self-esteem, trauma, or anxiety.</p>
