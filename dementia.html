            <h2>What is Dementia?</h2>
            <img src="dementia.png" alt="Dementia">
            <p>Dementia is an umbrella term for a range of cognitive impairments that affect memory, thinking, reasoning, and
                the ability to perform daily tasks. It is caused by damage to brain cells, which affects how individuals think, 
                behave, and feel. Dementia is progressive, meaning it worsens over time, and it can significantly impact an
                individualâ€™s ability to live independently.</p>
            <p>The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, but there are several other types, including vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="symptoms content-section">
            <h2>Symptoms of Dementia</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of dementia vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory Loss:</strong> Difficulty remembering recent events, appointments, or conversations.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty Thinking:</strong> Trouble with planning, problem-solving, and decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Disorientation:</strong> Confusion about time, place, or familiar people.</li>
                <li><strong>Language Problems:</strong> Difficulty finding the right words or understanding language.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Changes:</strong> Mood swings, irritability, depression, or apathy.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Ability to Perform Daily Tasks:</strong> Difficulty with tasks like dressing, cooking, or handling finances.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As dementia progresses, these symptoms can become more severe and interfere with daily life, requiring increased
                care and support.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="causes content-section">
            <h2>Causes of Dementia</h2>
            <p>Dementia is caused by damage to brain cells, which affects their ability to communicate with each other. The causes
                vary depending on the type of dementia, but some common factors include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alzheimer's Disease:</strong> The most common cause, characterized by the buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain.</li>
                <li><strong>Vascular Dementia:</strong> Caused by reduced blood flow to the brain due to stroke or other blood vessel problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Lewy Body Dementia:</strong> Characterized by abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies in the brain.</li>
                <li><strong>Frontotemporal Dementia:</strong> Caused by the progressive degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Factors:</strong> Age, genetics, head injuries, alcohol abuse, and certain medical conditions (such as high blood pressure or diabetes) can increase the risk of developing dementia.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="treatment content-section">
            <h2>Treatment for Dementia</h2>
            <p>While there is currently no cure for dementia, various treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment options include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors (Donepezil, Rivastigmine) may help manage symptoms by improving communication between brain cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Stimulation Therapy:</strong> Structured activities that improve memory, problem-solving, and social interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Therapies:</strong> Techniques used to address mood changes, agitation, or challenging behaviors in people with dementia.</li>
                <li><strong>Supportive Care:</strong> Ensuring a safe and supportive environment, including creating routines, minimizing distractions, and providing assistance with daily activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Caregiver Support:</strong> Caregivers play a critical role in managing dementia, and their well-being is essential. Support groups and respite care can help reduce stress and improve care outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With early intervention and the right support, people with dementia can maintain a better quality of life for longer.</p>
