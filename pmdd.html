            <h2>What is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)?</h2>
            <img src="pmdd.png" alt="Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder">
            <p>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) that affects women during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle (approximately two weeks before menstruation). It is characterized by debilitating physical and emotional symptoms that can significantly interfere with daily life, relationships, and overall well-being.</p>
            <p>PMDD is often mistaken for other mood disorders, but its onset is tied to the menstrual cycle. While PMS affects many women, PMDD is more severe, with symptoms that can be emotionally and physically overwhelming. Women experiencing PMDD may feel extreme irritability, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, which can interfere with their ability to function normally.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="symptoms content-section">
            <h2>Symptoms of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of PMDD can vary widely but typically include a combination of emotional, physical, and behavioral signs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Severe mood swings:</strong> Feelings of irritability, anger, or sadness, which can be overwhelming and difficult to control.</li>
                <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness that can impair daily activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> Feelings of nervousness, tension, or worry that are excessive and difficult to manage.</li>
                <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Extreme tiredness and low energy, even with adequate sleep.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep disturbances:</strong> Difficulty falling or staying asleep, or oversleeping.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical symptoms:</strong> Bloating, headaches, joint or muscle pain, and changes in appetite (e.g., cravings or overeating).</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty concentrating:</strong> Cognitive impairment or "brain fog," making it hard to focus or complete tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Social withdrawal:</strong> A tendency to withdraw from social activities or relationships due to irritability or fatigue.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The severity and combination of these symptoms can vary from person to person, and they typically resolve with the onset of menstruation.</p>

        <div class="causes content-section">
            <h2>Causes of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of PMDD is not fully understood, but it is believed to be influenced by a combination of hormonal fluctuations, genetic factors, and neurotransmitter imbalances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hormonal changes:</strong> PMDD is thought to be related to the hormonal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle. Fluctuations in estrogen, progesterone, and other hormones may contribute to the emotional and physical symptoms of PMDD.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurotransmitter imbalances:</strong> Changes in brain chemicals, such as serotonin, may play a role in mood regulation and contribute to the symptoms of PMDD.</li>
                <li><strong>Genetic factors:</strong> Some research suggests that women with a family history of PMDD or other mood disorders may be more likely to develop the condition.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental and lifestyle factors:</strong> Stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and substance abuse can exacerbate PMDD symptoms or make them more difficult to manage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Though PMDD can affect any woman of reproductive age, it is more common in those with a history of depression or other mood disorders.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="treatment content-section">
            <h2>Treatment for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)</h2>
            <p>There are several approaches to managing PMDD, including lifestyle changes, medication, and therapy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lifestyle changes:</strong> Regular exercise, a healthy diet, stress management techniques (like yoga or meditation), and adequate sleep can help reduce symptoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Anti-depressants (SSRIs and SNRIs), hormonal treatments (such as birth control pills or hormone therapy), and pain relievers can alleviate symptoms. In some cases, antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed to manage mood symptoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> CBT can help individuals manage emotional symptoms like anxiety and depression and improve coping strategies for dealing with PMDD.</li>
                <li><strong>Dietary supplements:</strong> Certain supplements, such as calcium, magnesium, and vitamin B6, may be recommended to help with mood stabilization and reduce physical symptoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Acupuncture or alternative therapies:</strong> Some individuals find relief from PMDD symptoms through alternative therapies like acupuncture, herbal treatments, or chiropractic care.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since PMDD symptoms are cyclical, it's important for individuals to work closely with healthcare providers to find the most effective treatment plan for their specific needs.</p>
