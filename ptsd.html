            <h2>What is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)?</h2>
            <img src="ptsd.png" alt="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">
            <p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a
                traumatic event. It is characterized by symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, and severe anxiety, which
                may persist for months or even years after the traumatic experience.</p>
            <p>PTSD can significantly impact a person's emotional well-being and daily functioning. However, with the right
                support and treatment, individuals with PTSD can recover and manage their symptoms effectively.</p>

        <div class="symptoms content-section">
            <h2>Symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of PTSD can vary, but common signs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flashbacks:</strong> Reliving the traumatic event through vivid and distressing memories or
                    flashbacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Nightmares:</strong> Recurring, disturbing dreams about the traumatic experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Numbness:</strong> Feeling detached or emotionally distant from others, along with
                    difficulty experiencing positive emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoidance:</strong> Avoiding reminders of the trauma, such as places, people, or activities that
                    may trigger memories.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyperarousal:</strong> Being easily startled, feeling tense or irritable, or having trouble
                    sleeping.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="causes content-section">
            <h2>Causes of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of PTSD is not fully understood, but several factors can contribute to its development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trauma:</strong> Experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as combat, natural disasters,
                    accidents, or violent assaults, is the primary risk factor for PTSD.</li>
                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> A family history of mental health disorders may increase the likelihood of
                    developing PTSD.</li>
                <li><strong>Brain Chemistry:</strong> Certain changes in the brain's chemistry and structure may make some
                    people more susceptible to PTSD.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Stress:</strong> Ongoing stressors, such as financial difficulties or social
                    isolation, may exacerbate PTSD symptoms.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="treatment content-section">
            <h2>Treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h2>
            <p>There are several effective treatments available to help manage PTSD symptoms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> CBT, particularly a type called Prolonged Exposure
                    Therapy (PE), is an effective treatment for PTSD. It involves facing the trauma and working through
                    distressing memories.</li>
                <li><strong>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):</strong> EMDR involves processing traumatic
                    memories through guided eye movements, helping individuals reframe negative associations with the
                    trauma.</li>
                <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Antidepressants, such as SSRIs, can help manage PTSD symptoms by balancing
                    brain chemicals.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Groups:</strong> Participating in support groups with others who have experienced trauma
                    can help reduce feelings of isolation and provide comfort and understanding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consulting a mental health professional is crucial for identifying the most suitable treatment plan for
                individuals with PTSD.</p>
