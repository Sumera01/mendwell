            <h2>What is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?</h2>
            <img src="autism.png" alt="Autism Spectrum Disorder">
            <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a wide range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by differences in social interactions, communication challenges, and restricted, repetitive behaviors. The "spectrum" aspect refers to the wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms individuals may experience. ASD can be diagnosed as early as 18 months, and its manifestations can range from mild to severe.</p>
            <p>ASD is a lifelong condition, but early intervention and appropriate therapies can help individuals with ASD live fulfilling and meaningful lives.</p>

        <!-- Symptoms Section -->
        <div class="symptoms content-section">
            <h2>Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of ASD may vary significantly, but common signs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Communication Challenges:</strong> Difficulty in establishing and maintaining conversations, reduced ability to understand social cues, and challenges in forming relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetitive Behaviors:</strong> Engaging in repetitive movements, activities, or rituals, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or insistence on sameness.</li>
                <li><strong>Restricted Interests:</strong> Intense focus on particular topics, objects, or activities, often to the exclusion of everything else.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty with Nonverbal Communication:</strong> Challenges in understanding or using body language, facial expressions, or gestures to communicate.</li>
                <li><strong>Sensory Sensitivities:</strong> Over- or under-sensitivity to sensory stimuli such as lights, sounds, textures, or smells.</li>
                <li><strong>Delayed Speech Development:</strong> Delays or difficulties in speaking or developing language skills, particularly in early childhood.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Causes Section -->
        <div class="causes content-section">
            <h2>Causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>
            <p>The exact causes of ASD are not fully understood, but several factors are believed to contribute to its development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> There is evidence that ASD runs in families, suggesting a genetic component. Certain genes may increase the risk of developing ASD.</li>
                <li><strong>Brain Structure and Function:</strong> Research suggests that differences in brain development and activity may play a role in the condition.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> While there is no single environmental cause, prenatal factors like maternal health, age, and complications during pregnancy may influence the risk of ASD.</li>
                <li><strong>Parental Age:</strong> Older parental age has been associated with a higher likelihood of a child developing ASD.</li>
                <li><strong>Premature Birth:</strong> Being born prematurely or having a low birth weight may increase the likelihood of developing ASD.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Treatment Section -->
        <div class="treatment content-section">
            <h2>Treatment and Support for Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>
            <p>There is no cure for ASD, but various treatments and interventions can help individuals manage their symptoms and lead a fulfilling life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Therapy:</strong> Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is commonly used to help individuals with ASD develop social and communication skills through structured teaching techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech and Language Therapy:</strong> Therapy that helps individuals improve communication skills, whether verbal or nonverbal, and addresses issues related to understanding and using language.</li>
                <li><strong>Occupational Therapy:</strong> Focuses on improving the individual's ability to perform daily tasks, such as dressing, eating, and personal hygiene, and may also address sensory processing issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Skills Training:</strong> Teaching individuals how to interact appropriately with others and understand social norms and cues.</li>
                <li><strong>Medication:</strong> While there is no medication specifically for ASD, medications may be used to manage symptoms such as anxiety, depression, or hyperactivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Family Support:</strong> Support for family members is crucial to help them understand the condition and provide the best care and encouragement for individuals with ASD.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Early intervention is important in improving the outcomes for individuals with ASD. The earlier a child receives support, the better the potential for development.</p>
