            <h2>What is Bipolar Disorder?</h2>
            <img src="bipolar.png" alt="Bipolar Disorder">
            <p>Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional
                highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood changes can affect sleep, energy levels,
                behavior, judgment, and the ability to think clearly. The frequency and severity of the mood swings can
                vary from person to person, and the condition can have a significant impact on daily life.</p>
            <p>While the exact cause of bipolar disorder is not fully understood, it is thought to be a combination of
                genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Treatment can help manage symptoms and improve the quality
                of life for those with bipolar disorder.</p>

        <!-- Symptoms Section -->
        <div class="symptoms content-section">
            <h2>Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of bipolar disorder can vary depending on the phase of the mood cycle, but common signs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manic/Hypomanic Episodes:</strong> These episodes include elevated or irritable mood, increased
                    energy, racing thoughts, impulsivity, and risky behavior. In severe cases, mania can lead to psychosis.</li>
                <li><strong>Depressive Episodes:</strong> Depressive episodes are characterized by feelings of sadness, low
                    energy, difficulty concentrating, changes in sleep and appetite, and thoughts of death or suicide.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Cycling:</strong> Some individuals experience rapid cycling, where they have four or more
                    mood episodes in a year.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixed Episodes:</strong> A mixed episode involves symptoms of both mania and depression at the
                    same time, which can be especially challenging to manage.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Causes Section -->
        <div class="causes content-section">
            <h2>Causes of Bipolar Disorder</h2>
            <p>The causes of bipolar disorder are not fully understood, but several factors may contribute to its development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> A family history of bipolar disorder increases the risk of developing the
                    condition. However, not everyone with a family history will develop the disorder.</li>
                <li><strong>Brain Structure and Chemistry:</strong> Abnormalities in brain function and the regulation of
                    neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, may play a role in the development of bipolar disorder.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Stress:</strong> Stressful life events, such as trauma, abuse, or significant
                    life changes, can trigger or worsen bipolar episodes in individuals with a genetic predisposition.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Treatment Section -->
        <div class="treatment content-section">
            <h2>Treatment for Bipolar Disorder</h2>
            <p>There are several effective treatments for bipolar disorder, which may include a combination of medication and
                therapy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Mood stabilizers, antipsychotic medications, and antidepressants are commonly
                    prescribed to help regulate mood and manage symptoms during manic and depressive episodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> CBT can help individuals with bipolar disorder manage
                    their symptoms by addressing negative thinking patterns and teaching coping strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT):</strong> This therapy focuses on helping individuals
                    maintain a stable routine and manage interpersonal relationships, which can reduce the risk of mood swings.</li>
                <li><strong>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT):</strong> In severe cases, ECT may be used to treat bipolar disorder when other treatments are not effective.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important for individuals with bipolar disorder to work closely with their healthcare provider to find
                the most effective treatment plan.</p>
