            <h2>What is Hoarding Disorder?</h2>
            <img src="hoarding.png" alt="Hoarding Disorder">
            <p>Hoarding Disorder is a mental health condition characterized by the persistent difficulty of discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value. This behavior can lead to a cluttered living space that interferes with daily functioning and often results in distress or problems with relationships and work. Hoarding is more than just collecting; it becomes a disorder when the accumulation of items creates significant impairment or risk to health and safety.</p>
            <p>The condition is often associated with other mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and it can significantly impact the individual’s quality of life. Treatment often involves therapy and, in some cases, medication to help manage the symptoms and improve functioning.</p>
