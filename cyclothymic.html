            <h2>What is Cyclothymic Disorder?</h2>
            <img src="cyclothymic.png" alt="Cyclothymic Disorder">
            <p>Cyclothymic disorder (also known as cyclothymia) is a mood disorder characterized by periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a full-blown manic or depressive episode. These mood swings can cause significant distress or impairment in the individual's life, but they are typically less severe than those experienced in bipolar disorder.</p>
            <p>The hypomanic episodes involve elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, and impulsivity, while depressive episodes may include feelings of sadness, low energy, and lack of interest in daily activities. The condition can lead to challenges in work, relationships, and personal functioning. While cyclothymic disorder is considered a chronic condition, with proper treatment and management, individuals can lead fulfilling lives.</p>

        <!-- Causes Section -->
        <div class="causes content-section">
            <h2>Causes of Cyclothymic Disorder</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of cyclothymic disorder is not fully understood, but several factors may contribute to its development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genetic factors:</strong> A family history of mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder, may increase the likelihood of developing cyclothymic disorder.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurochemical imbalances:</strong> Imbalances in brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that regulate mood may play a role in the condition.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Stress, trauma, or other environmental factors may trigger or worsen the symptoms of cyclothymic disorder.</li>
                <li><strong>Brain structure and function:</strong> Abnormalities in brain structure or functioning may be associated with mood disorders, including cyclothymia.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding the underlying causes is important for effective treatment and management.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Treatment Section -->
