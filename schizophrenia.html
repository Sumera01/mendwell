            <h2>What is Schizophrenia?</h2>
            <img src="schizophrenia.png" alt="Schizophrenia">
            <p>Schizophrenia is a severe mental health disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It
                can cause significant changes in a personâ€™s ability to differentiate between reality and imagination.
                Schizophrenia is not the same as having a "split personality" (as commonly misunderstood), but rather, it
                involves experiencing delusions, hallucinations, and severe disruptions in thought patterns.</p>
            <p>While the exact cause of schizophrenia is still unknown, it is believed to be a combination of genetic,
                biological, and environmental factors. It affects about 1 in 100 people globally, and with the right
                treatment, individuals with schizophrenia can lead fulfilling lives.</p>

        <div class="symptoms content-section">
            <h2>Symptoms of Schizophrenia</h2>
            <p>Schizophrenia symptoms may vary from person to person, but some of the most common symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> False perceptions of reality, such as hearing voices or seeing things
                    that are not there.</li>
                <li><strong>Delusions:</strong> Strongly held false beliefs, such as thinking someone is plotting against them
                    or believing they have special powers.</li>
                <li><strong>Disorganized Thinking:</strong> Difficulty in organizing thoughts, making it hard to speak clearly
                    or logically.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative Symptoms:</strong> Lack of motivation, withdrawal from social activities, and reduced
                    ability to experience pleasure.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="causes content-section">
            <h2>Causes of Schizophrenia</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown, but several factors are believed to contribute:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> A family history of schizophrenia increases the likelihood of developing the
                    disorder.</li>
                <li><strong>Brain Chemistry and Structure:</strong> Imbalances in certain brain chemicals (such as dopamine)
                    and structural changes in the brain may contribute to schizophrenia.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Stressful life events or childhood trauma may act as triggers for
                    the disorder in those predisposed to it.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="treatment content-section">
            <h2>Treatment for Schizophrenia</h2>
            <p>There are several effective treatment options available for schizophrenia, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Antipsychotic Medications:</strong> These medications are the primary treatment for schizophrenia and
                    help manage symptoms like delusions and hallucinations.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> CBT can help individuals manage their symptoms and
                    improve their coping skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Supportive Therapy:</strong> Therapy involving social support can help individuals manage everyday
                    challenges, build skills, and improve social functioning.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With a combination of medication and therapy, people with schizophrenia can work towards managing their symptoms
                and improving their quality of life.</p>
